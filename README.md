Stock Market Analysis using Data Analytics
- with an interpretation of the results

Project Overview
1. Adjusted Close Price Analysis Purpose:
   - Tracks the long-term growth trajectory and recovery cycles of the "Big Five".
   - Key Insight: Highlights the divergent recovery paths post-2022, specifically Meta’s volatile "V-shape" versus Apple and Microsoft’s more consistent upward slopes.
2. Returns Distribution (Volatility) Purpose:
   - Visualizes daily percentage changes to identify periods of high market stress and "heartbeat" stability.
   - Key Insight: Identifies significant outliers, such as the 2020 pandemic shock and Meta’s extreme $\pm 20\%$ swings compared to Google’s relatively compact return profile.
3. Volume Distribution (Conviction) Purpose:
   - Measures trading activity to determine the strength and participation behind price movements.
   - Key Insight: Reveals a notable "Price-Volume Divergence," where recent record-high prices are being achieved on significantly lower trading volumes compared to the 2017–2021 period.
